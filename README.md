# BES-XPCS-Pilot

DOE-BES Data Science Team for facilitating inter-facility communication of XPCS data.

This repository provides tools to communicate data into (and out from) the Bluesky framework
using NeXus/HDF5 data files.  The files will use a NeXus Application Definition `NXxpcs`
developed (for contribution to the [NeXus 'definitions' 
repository](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions)) as part of this repository.
Additional NeXus definitions (such as to describe the image masks unique to this
technique) may be developed as well.

The first major goal is to import results computed by tools outside of the Bluesky
framework for use by the [Xi-cam](https://github.com/ronpandolfi/Xi-cam) visualization software.

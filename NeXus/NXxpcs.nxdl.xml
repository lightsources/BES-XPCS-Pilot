    X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) data (results).

    The purpose of NXxpcs is to document and communicate an accepted vanacular for various XPCS data 
    in order to suppport development of community software tools.  The definition presented here only
    represents a starting point and contains fields that a common software tool should support for 
    community acceptance.

    Additional fields may be added to XPCS results file (forrmally or informally).  It is expected 
    that this XPCS data will be part of multi-modal data set that could involve e.g. NXcansas or 
    1D and/or 2D data.

    **QUESTION** it seems we are missing the "average" image. was this intensional?

            Typically, $g_2$ is a quantity calculated for a group of pixels reprenting a specific 
            region of reciprocal space.  These groupings, or bins, are generically desribed as q. Some 
            open-source XPCS librarys refer to these bins as "rois", which are not to be confused with 
            EPICS AreaDetector ROI. See usage guidelines for q_lists and roi_maps within 
            <a href="/NXxpcs/entry/instrument/masks-group">mask</a>.
            <!-- TODO: ensure link to mask section on this page works -->
            In short, $g_2$ should be ordered according to the roi_map value. The data should be in one
            of the following two formats:
            <list type="bullet">
              <item>
                <description>iterable list of linked files for each $g_2$ with 1 file per q </description>

                <description>2D array with shape ($g_2$, q) </description>
              </item>

              **QUESTION** enforcing array shape/order seems like a bad idea. NeXus has away to 
              tag the positions. <a href="https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXdata.html#nxdata"> 2Ddata</a>
            
              **QUESTIION** should we add an attriibute for data method (list of file links versus arrays)?

              **QUESTION** should we add a sketch of g2 plot with error bars, delay_difference, and 
              baseline as an illustratory example?

              **QUESTION** should we talk more about expected length of data (we have not length 
              consistency checks).  These checks are probably up to developers, but by docummenting
              here, maybe this makes it easier?

          It is the "quantized" delay time corresponding to the ``g2`` values.

          The unit of delay_differences is NX_INT for units of frames (i.e. integers) preferred,

          in which time is quantized by frames. In short, this correlation function should be ordered 
          according to the q or roi index with the origin of the 2D array at the **lower left**.  The data 
          should be in one of the following two formats:
            <list type="bullet">
              <item>

          Other normalization methods may be applied, but the method will not be specfied in this 
          defintion. Some of these normalization methods result in a baseline value of ``0``, not ``1``.

          **QUESTION** do we want to enforce lower left for origin? is this okay if the two-time 
          origin is not consistent with the image origin? We will add an example 2time

          **QUESTION** 8ID data has only half populated 2time (to save on data).  Seems we need
          an attribute for this as well.

          XPCS data is typically produced by an areadetector as a stack of 2D images. Sometimes
          this data is represented in different ways (sparse arrays or photon event list), but this detail
          is left to the analysis software.  Therefore, we only include We note that the image origin
          (pixel coordinates (0,0)) are found at the top left of a single 2D image array. This 
          is the standard expected by  <a href="https://cxidb.org/cxi.html">Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank</a>. 
          See CXI version 1.6 and Maia, Nature Methods (2012). 
        
          Additionally, all but ``frame_time`` are inhereited from NXdetector. ``frame_time`` is used to

          **QUESTION** It seems this top-left is matplotlib default and informal convention of AreaDetector.
          However, in reading the CXI documentation, top-left is the example in Fig 11. Fig 12 shows
          it is perspective dependant. We need to make a decision here - do we always convert or do
          we add attributes that allows someone to convert to CXI format (speckle oversampling for single frame CDI)

            The ``units`` attribute should be set to ``"au"``
            indicating arbitrary units.

      Describes the minimum requirements regarding equilbrium sample conditions. NXsample
      permits other quantities (e.g., applied fields, crystallographic information, name, etc) that

      dynamics from XPCS analysis).

      For non-equilibrrium sample conditions (i.e., changing sample or process conditions 
      during the XPCS measurement) will require either a new entry or an additional atttribute.
